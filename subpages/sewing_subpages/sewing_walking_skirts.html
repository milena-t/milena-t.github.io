            <h1 id="grey-linen-skirt">Grey Linen Skirt</h1>
                <p>
                    I have one skirt pattern that is inspired by a victorian walking skirt that I have made several times in different variations and fabrics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I made a grey linen skirt inspired by an edwardian walking skirt with orange piping and the hem is finished with double folded tape 
                    from the same fabric as the piping. There is some piecing, the closure is just a single button and a plastic zipper that I somehow by 
                    chance already had in an exactly matching color. I didn't hang up the skirt for long enough before hemming, and the weave of the linen 
                    is very loose, so the hem has warped a bit. 
                </p>

            <h1 id="striped-skirt">Light Blue Striped Skirt</h1>
                <p>
                    This skirt is made from thrifted curtains that were originally a very light beige, and I overdyed them with cool-toned black. Since they were 
                    a cotton/polyester blend, the stripes took the colors differently well, resulting in this pattern. They close with a button on the waistband and 
                    then two pairs of hooks and eyes above a zipper (I didn't have a zipper of the right length). The hem is a hand-sewn blind hem.
                </p>

            <h1 id="heavy-wool-skirt">Heavy Wool Skirt</h1>
                <p>
                    This skirt is from a very heavy wool-polyester blend that makes it heavy but also very warm. Perfect for -10Â°C or less outside.
                    It closes with a large metal button and a long metal zipper. It has a large pocket anchored to the waistband, and there is some 
                    piecing in the pattern pieces along the hem. The waistband is drafted on a slight curve.
                </p>
