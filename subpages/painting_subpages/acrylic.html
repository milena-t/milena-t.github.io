                    So that I don't have to repeat myself every time: all pieces are sanded and primed with two layers of gesso. 
                    I have the cheap acrylic paints from Clas Ohlsson in primary colors, plus green and dark brown and I mixed all shades from these.
                    All pieces are sealed with the matte indoor varnish from panduro.

                    An IKEA Lack coffee table that was originally black.

                    This is a 3D printed shelf that goes over the radiator in our bathroom across from the toilet. Colors are more accurate on the right picture.
