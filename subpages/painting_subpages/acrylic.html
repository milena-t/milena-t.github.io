                <p>
                    All pieces are first sanded and primed with two layers of gesso. 
                    I have the cheap acrylic paints from Clas Ohlsson in primary colors, plus green and dark brown and I mixed all shades from these.
                    All pieces are sealed with the matte indoor varnish from panduro.

                <h1 id="fish-table">Yellow fish coffee table</h1>
                <p>
                    An IKEA Lack coffee table that was originally black.

                <h1 id="snake-shelf">Lavender snakes bathroom shelf</h1>
                <p>
                    This is a 3D printed shelf that goes over the radiator in our bathroom across from the toilet. Colors are more accurate on the right picture.

                <h1 id="bookends">Forest green book ends</h1>
                <p>
                    Two pairs of 3D printed book ends, one with cup and one without per pair. The third picture (not-sun cup) is the most color accurate, but still slightly cool-toned.
