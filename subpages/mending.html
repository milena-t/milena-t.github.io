                        I found this mansfield skirt suit at Myrorna, it's from Mansfield, made in England, but it was a tiny bit tight in the 
                        sleeves for me. I added small inserts into the sleeves, and I also added a pocket in the skirt between the pleats. 
                        (I also made the shirt that I am wearing in these pictures, but it's really not very good so I won't write about it.)

                    <p>
                        I found these nice pants at a thrift store in berlin, and I adjusted the waistband and added a pocket.
