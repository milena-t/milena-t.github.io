                <h1>Winter Cape</h1>
                    <h2>Fabric selection</h2>
                        <p>
                            I wanted it to be out of 100% wool, both so that it's properly warm and a little water repellent, but also
                            to make the tailoring very fun and satisfying. My first idea was to buy a really nice high quality
                            wool from <a href="https://www.historicalfabricstore.com/heavywools">historicalfabricstore</a>, 
                            But i also didn't want to be bankrupt. I ordered the swatches and they luckily a little lighter than i was going for anyways.
                            In the end, I went to syfestivalen and bought heavy felted wool and a medium weight linen for the lining 
                            from <a href="https://www.korps.se/">korps</a> at a discount. Still pricy, but the wool is so nice and thick i think it was worth it.
                        </p>
                    <h2>Pattern drafting & construction</h2>
                        <p>
                            The pattern is a frankenstein construction between the self-drafted triangle shoulder pieces that I also use for shirts, the side pieces
                            from the American Duchess <a href="https://www.americanduchess.com/products/wrap-cape-free-pattern-pdf">wrap cape</a> and the front and back 
                            pieces are inspired by the cape pattern from New Look (No. 6535, but I only really used the length of the back piece to start with because I
                            really don't like the cut of this cape at all).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The important thing in the construction is to baste together the lining and outer wool all over the body pieces, otherwise they will just
                            slip wherever. Every seam around the neck and closure are enforced with cotton twill tape that is also used to make a hanger loop that is attached
                            to the back point where the most weight hangs. 
                             There is also heavyweight interfacing padstitched into the shoulder pieces and collar. Every seam is finished by enclosing
                            it in double-folded straight grain tape, including the bottom of the floating lining. The hem of the outer fabric is not finished because
                            the felted wool does not fray. Maybe when I feel like it one day i will add a tablet woven hem, or I find a nice thin fabric in a similar
                            dark grey color to finish it. I have some future ideas to add rouleaux 
                            trim (like explained <a href="https://fabricnfiction.wordpress.com/2018/10/08/how-to-make-rouleaux-trim/">here</a>) to the shoulder pieces, 
                            but it takes a lot of monotone hand sewing, so it might be a long time until i actually feel like doing it. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The top is closed with hooks and eyes (threadworked loops), and the loop-side of the closure is supported through a piece of boning 
                            (6mm cable tie) that the loops are worked around. This was a great idea, since the wool is so heavy and this really adds integrity to the 
                            closure which has to take a lot of strain. The front below that closes with an old sweatshirt-zipper I got from Patrick's broken
                            jacket. The arm slits can also be closed with zippers (that don't open at the bottom), which I added after the fact after wearing it
                            once and realzed that the wind goes in there and makes it difficult to retain warmth. I also added two welt pockets on the inside on 
                            both sides. They are a little lower than I had intended, but still functional. The lining is a pretty loose weave and it might have been
                            good to attach these to the shoulder seams with some tape, but it's not been problematic yet.

                        <p>
                            I really like how it turned out, and while it's pretty heavy to lift, it actually doesn't feel that heavy to wear to me. The weight
                            means that it doesn't lift in the wind and retains heat super well, especially if you close the arm slits all the way. However, I already 
                            dress weird so I'm used to being stared at, but I have never been stared at as much as when I wear this cape.

                <h1>Black historical reproduction skirt from patterns of fashoin 2</h1>
                    <h2>Pattern enlarging</h2>
                        <p>Draft the pattern on my favourite white paper table cloth and do some math to make sure the waistband fits me.
                            Don't make it longer, because this woman was tiny and the skirt is tea length on me which is what i was going for.

                    <h2>construction</h2>
                        <p>
                            I made a janky af waistband, and had to insert a line of piping because i accidentally miscalculated the seam allowances 
                            but it looks great. I also tried to do a bind hem but the wool is so drapey and delicate that you still can kind of see.
                            at least there's no seamline
