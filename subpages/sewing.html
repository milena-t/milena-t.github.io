                    <h2>Fabric selection</h2>
                        <p>
                            I wanted it to be out of 100% wool, both so that it's properly warm and a little water repellent, but also
                            to make the tailoring very fun and satisfying. My first idea was to buy a really nice high quality
                            wool from <a href="https://www.historicalfabricstore.com/heavywools">historicalfabricstore</a>, 
                            But i also didn't want to be bankrupt. I ordered the swatches and they were very nice, but luckily a little lighter than i was going for.
                            In the end, I went to syfestivalen and bought heavy felted wool and a medium weight linen for the lining 
                            from <a href="https://www.korps.se/">korps</a> at a discount. Still pricy, but the wool is so nice and thick i think it was worth it.
                        </p>
                    <h2>Pattern drafting & construction</h2>
                        <p>
                            The pattern is a frankenstein construction between the self-drafted triangle shoulder pieces that I also use for shirts, the side pieces
                            from the American Duchess <a href="https://www.americanduchess.com/products/wrap-cape-free-pattern-pdf">wrap cape</a> and the front and back 
                            pieces are inspired by the cape pattern from New Look (No. 6535, but I only used the neckline and collar because I
                            really don't like the cut of this cape at all).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The important thing in the construction is to baste together the lining and outer wool all over the body pieces, otherwise they will just
                            slip wherever. Every seam around the neck and closure are enforced with cotton twill tape that is also used to make a hanger loop that is attached
                            to the back point where the most weight hangs. 
                             There is also heavyweight interfacing padstitched into the shoulder pieces and collar. Every seam is finished by enclosing
                            it in double-folded straight grain tape, including the bottom of the floating lining. The hem of the outer fabric is not finished because
                            the felted wool does not fray. Maybe when I feel like it one day i will add a tablet woven hem, or I find a nice thin fabric in a similar
                            dark grey color to finish it. I have some future ideas to add rouleaux 
                            trim (like explained <a href="https://fabricnfiction.wordpress.com/2018/10/08/how-to-make-rouleaux-trim/">here</a>) to the shoulder pieces, 
                            but it takes a lot of monotone hand sewing, so it might be a long time until i actually feel like doing it. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The top is closed with hooks and eyes (threadworked loops), and the loop-side of the closure is supported through a piece of boning 
                            (6mm cable tie) that the loops are worked around. This was a great idea, since the wool is so heavy and this really adds integrity to the 
                            closure which has to take a lot of strain. The front below that closes with an old sweatshirt-zipper I got from Patrick's broken
                            jacket. The arm slits can also be closed with zippers (that don't open at the bottom), which I added after the fact after wearing it
                            once and realzed that the wind goes in there and makes it difficult to retain warmth. I also added two welt pockets on the inside on 
                            both sides. They are a little lower than I had intended, but still functional. The lining is a pretty loose weave and it might have been
                            good to attach these to the shoulder seams with some tape, but it's not been problematic yet. 

                        </p>

                    <h2>Finished garment</h2>    
                        <p>
                            I really like how it turned out, and while it's pretty heavy to lift, it actually doesn't feel that heavy to wear to me. The weight
                            means that it doesn't lift in the wind and retains heat super well, especially if you close the arm slits all the way. However, I already 
                            dress weird so I'm used to being stared at, but I have never been stared at as much as when I wear this cape.

                <h1 id="patterns-of-fashion-2-skirt">Black historical reproduction skirt</h1>
                    <h2>Pattern</h2>
                        <p>
                            The pattern is from <a href="https://shop.theschoolofhistoricaldress.org.uk/product/patterns-of-fashion-2-the-content-cut-construction-and-context-of-european-womens-dress-c-1860-1940-in-english-and-french-collections/?v=7885444af42e">Patterns of Fashion 2</a>, 
                            it is the skirt from "day dress in pink linen with an embroidered cotton net gilet". Since it's a historical pattern, it was 
                            one size taken directly from the garment, so I had to adjust it to my measurements. I extended the center front outward 
                            to fit my waist measurement, and I also enlarged the angle fron the waist seam to the center front to accomodate my larger waist-to-hip ratio.
                            The skirt back is gathered originally, but I used more "stiff" wool, so i decided to do three knife-pleats instead, which
                            has worked well and I didn't need to make hip darts. I did not lengthen the skirt, since the original pattern ends up kind of 
                            tea-length on me and I think that looks nice.
                        </p>
                    <h2>construction</h2>
                        <p>
                            For the main skirt, i used relatively stiff suiting wool, and the dark lavender back insert panel is a fabric remnant I ordered 
                            somewhere, I don't remember what it was. 
                            I made a janky af waistband, and had to insert a line of piping because i accidentally miscalculated the seam allowances 
                            but it looks great. The back closes with two heavy-duty hooks and eyes. I also tried to do a blind hem at the bottom but the wool is so drapey and delicate that you still can kind of see.
                            at least there's no seamline. The back has covered buttons in the same dark lavender fabric as the insert panel. There is heavyweight
                            interfacing in the curvy panel underneat the buttons, that is fixed with padstitching and also contrasting topstitching in thread 
                            that matches the lavender contrast panel. One side of the buttons covers the closure, and the other side has a pocket. The pocket 
                            placement is pretty inconvenient and makes a weird shape when I put my phone in, but there is no side seam and it is better than no 
                            pocket at all.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also made an underskirt of viscose lining fabric with curtain weights in the bottom that really improves the drape and "swoosh"
                            of the skirt.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I saw Andor season 1 and immediately became obsessed with the costumes, especially the outfits Mon Mothma wears. I decided 
                            to reproduce this jacket and made a complementary skirt (since my body shape doesn't really go with the very straight cut the rest 
                            of her costumes have). I drafted the pattern by eye and made a few mockups for the jacket, the outer fabric is light wool suiting in dark grey 
                            with thin white stripes and the lining is viscose. There is medium-weight interfacing in the jacket body and the sleeve hem. 
                            The skirt top has boning (6mm cable ties), keeping the point at the back upright. The jacket closes with two metal hooks and threadbars.

                        <p>
                            I made this to wear to a wedding. The jacket cut is from a jacket from Andor season 1 that Mon Mothma wears at some point and i immediately became obsessed with.
                            There is pretty heavy interfacing in the jacket front, I should have gone lighter, and I used heat'n'bond to attach it to the outer fabric.
                            This left some stains on one side, which is what I embroidered over. The top and trousers are self-designed and drafted. The fabric 
                            is an IKEA cotton bedsheet.

                            I bought a huge IKEA bedsheet for the Wedding outfit, so from the rest I made a tiered ruffle dress. The pattern is all self-drafted 
                            and the shoulder pieces are the same ones as in a bunch of my shirts. The ruffles are a lot, the bottm most tier is like 7 meters. 
                            All seams on the inside are boud with double-folded tape from the same fabric.

                            I made a cape of <i>Callosobruchus maculauts</i> elytra as a halloween costume in 2023. They are made with a base of 
                            old IKEA canvas curtains, and then a bunch of different scraps in various shades of brown are turned into patches and then 
                            topstitched on. in the front, they tie with a bow, and the shoulders are constructed kind of like kimono sleeves. The entire outside 
                            is bound with stretchy double-fold tape.

                        <p>
                            One of the first things I ever made, because the hubris is real, from a free mood fabrics costume pattern for a game of thrones 
                            Daenerys season 7 costume. I modified it quite a bit though. The outer fabric is a wool-polyester blend and has a slight dark blue 
                            tartan pattern on a black base. The entire coat is interlined with a layer of cotton, and the sleeves have two layers of the outer wool for extra warmth. 
                            The lining is viscose (I think?). There is mid-weight interfacing in the front pieces, collar, and sleeve cuffs.
                            The fur in the sleeve cuffs and collar is real, I bought scraps from a Sami craftswoman's shop in Kiruma, and it is so nice and warm, like 
                            an in-built scarf. 
                        </p>

                            the outer fabric is wool felt, and the lining is quilting cotton. I added a neck loop to hang it up, and it closes with heavy-duty hooks and eyes.
                            I attached the collar the wrong way around on accident, and now it is pointier than intended but that's fine. There is no interfacing anywhere.

                        <p>
                            I have one skirt pattern that is inspired by a victorian walking skirt that I have made several times in different variations and fabrics.
                        </p>
                    
                        <h2 id="grey-linen-skirt">Grey Linen Skirt</h2>
                        <p>
                            I made a grey linen skirt inspired by an edwardian walking skirt with orange piping and the hem is finished with double folded tape 
                            from the same fabric as the piping. There is some piecing, the closure is just a single button and a plastic zipper that I somehow by 
                            chance already had in an exactly matching color. I didn't hang up the skirt for long enough before hemming, and the weave of the linen 
                            is very loose, so the hem has warped a bit.

                        <p>
                            This skirt is made from thrifted curtains that were originally a very light beige, and I overdyed them with cool-toned black. Since they were 
                            a cotton/polyester blend, the stripes took the colors differently well, resulting in this pattern. They close with a button on the waistband and 
                            then two pairs of hooks and eyes above a zipper (I didn't have a zipper of the right length). The hem is a hand-sewn blind hem.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This skirt is from a very heavy wool-polyester blend that makes it heavy but also very warm. Perfect for -10°C or less outside.
                            It closes with a large metal button and a long metal zipper. It has a large pocket anchored to the waistband, and there is some 
                            piecing in the pattern pieces along the hem. The waistband is drafted on a slight curve.
                        </p>

                    <h1 id="ruffle-skirt">Ruffle Skirt</h1>
                        <p>
                            This skirt is made from a secondhand linen tablecloth with lace insertion. It used to be light beige, but I over-dyed it 
                            with a cool-toned black dye. The thread is contrasting white, because I made the skirt from un-dyed fabric with no plan to 
                            dye it and used matching white polyester thread. This thread didn't dye, and is now contrasting. The skirt closes with a 
                            button on the waistband and a zipper. There is a large pocket next to the zipper that is anchored to the waistband, making it
                            very stable.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I drafted a shirt pattern with shoulder pieces that make a downward-pointed shape on the back and front, where the shape has a button (or hook 
                            and eye) closure. This is my go-to shirt pattern that I have made several times.

                            Black cotton shirt with hook and eye neck closure and buttoned cuffs. Symmetrical pinstripes in the frond and one pleat on each side in the back.

                            Orange linen shirt, with two pleats in the front (asymmetrical because I can't count) and two in the back. Button closure on the neck, and same 
                            buttons on the cuffs.

                    <h1 id="many-eyed-shirt">Grey Collared Shirt</h1>
                        <p>
                            This shirt is made from an old linen tablecloth that I dyed in the second dye bath of a black dye, resulting in this light grey color. 
                            The point has one piece of boning (6mm cable tie) next to the buttonholes.
                        </p>
