                <h1>Fish skeleton (as seen at the Vienna natural history museum)</h1>
                    <p>
                        This is traced directly from a fish skeleton that I took a picture of in the Vienna Natural History museum.
                        That entire marine exhibition was so good and artistic in general.

                        Inspired by the specimen from the uppsala zoology museum that's in 
                        the window in the wall between the museum locker room and the biology library.
