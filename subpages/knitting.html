                <h1>Beetle sweater</h1>
                <p> 
                    The base sweater pattern is a raglan from petiteknit (Monday sweater), and I originally created the repeating color chart in excel myself,
                    you can download it <a href="../images/knitting/cmac_sweater_repeats.pdf">here</a>.
                    Unfortunately, I miscounted some stitches when casting on the neckline, so the yolk is pretty small, making it kind of tight
                    under the armpits. Still wearable, but essentially zero ease.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I promise I finished weaving in the ends after taking this picture. It is also unblocked here, but I didn't
                    stretch it so it looks about the same.

                <h1>Beetle cowl</h1>
                <p>
                    Beetle cowl scarf from Sandnes Garn Peer Gynt yarn, very warm and wind-proof, perfect for winter biking. 
                    I made a pattern with the color chart and instructions, download it <a href="../images/knitting/beetle_cowl_pattern_with_instructions.pdf">here</a>!
