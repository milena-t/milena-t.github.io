                <p>
                    I made this rat out of some scrap red wool for no purpose or reason. It's stuffed with more scrap fabric and thread.

                <h1 id="red-rat">Sewing Project Bag</h1>
                <p>
                    This is a bag for portable small sewing or embroidery projects also made from scrap and heavyweight fusible interfacing. 
                    It's based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uy905rVcv-A">this tutorial</a>, 
                    but I changed the measurements slightly to make it a bit larger. This also made the front overlap very small because I 
                    scaled it incorrectly I think, so if I were to do it again I would just elongate the bottom flap as well to make it completely symmetrical. 
                    I added the little center zipper bag to close the overlap more securely so that nothing falls out.
                    It is mostly nice because it turns into a little tray when you open it.
                </p>
